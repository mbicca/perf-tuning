# perf-tuning
Performance tuning scripts for Linux

This is a list of pre-configured files that should help with performance tuning on Linux servers.

I am trying to keep most of the options documented with references, so you can check for recommendations, default values and understand how those will affect a system.

The structure will be as folows:

perf-tuning --> operating system / distro

I am also planning to add a separate folder under each distro related to settings specific to security as well.
